# Project Documentation

**Please read AGENTS.md for complete technical documentation.**

All project documentation, technical details, and implementation notes have been moved to `AGENTS.md`. Please refer to that file for:

- Tech stack details
- Project structure
- Database schema
- API endpoints
- Deployment instructions
- Known issues and solutions
- Development workflow

Any future updates to project documentation should be made in `AGENTS.md` instead of this file.
